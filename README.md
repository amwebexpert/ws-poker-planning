# WSPokerPlanning


![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/amwebexpert/ws-poker-planning) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](./LICENSE)

Poker planning sessions server handing communications through WebSocket. Once this server is started, it manages an in-memory map of rooms with connected socket clients. Sockets clients can specify a roomUUID and once connected all messages are private to that room.

1. the client side connects through a web socket URL and specify a roomUUID param. Example: `ws://localhost:8080/ws?roomUUID=xxxyyyzzz`
1. the server upgrades the connection to a full duplex web socket channel and reply with the whole room current state
1. the client socket can then:
   - emit a message to update the room state by using `socket.send()`
   - receive room updates asynchrously through the `socket.onmessage()`

## Build and start (production mode)

    npm run build
    npm start

## Start in development mode (with hot reload)

    npm run start:dev

## Localhost deployment

If the `process.env.PORT` is undefined the default port becomes `8080`

- ws://localhost:8080/ws

## WSPokerPlanning server production deployment

The `ws-poker-planning` server is a pure `Node.js` backend app that can be easyly deployed on public cloud engines like [Heroku](https://heroku.com/). You can deploy and start the app locally for testing purpose, but if you want real live web sockets support we suggest a deployment on:

- your own enterprise internal servers where all your VPN connected users can see the running server
- cloud solutions providers like `AWS`, `GCP`, `Azure`...

The production app has been deployed at the following location(s):
- `butter-sneaky-waitress.glitch.me` - project deployed on [glitch.com](https://butter-sneaky-waitress.glitch.me)
- `amwebexpert.linkpc.net` - access it here: [https://amwebexpert.linkpc.net](https://amwebexpert.linkpc.net)

You can also deploy it on your internal server because:
- all your poker planning sessions are going to be private (only visible through your VPN for instance)
- you can still take advantage of the full poker planning client app (see below) since the hostname and port are just a configuration

## Full poker planning client app (PROD)

The [Web Toolbox](https://amwebexpert.github.io/etoolbox/#/PokerPlanning) includes a full front end implementation of the Poker planning session. To start a poker planning session:

- ensure the server is up and running
- open the [Web Toolbox](https://amwebexpert.github.io/etoolbox/#/PokerPlanning) UI
- type the hostname:portnumber inside the `Server` field. No need to provide the port if it's the default one (`80` for `http` or `443` for `https`). For instance:
  - `butter-sneaky-waitress.glitch.me`
- type the name of your team inside the `Team name` field
- type your username in the corresponding field
- press the share button so the full poker planning session link can be shared with other team members
- the resulting link is going to include the generated room number, the server, and the team name so it can be safely bookmarked for future poker planning sessions

## Full poker planning client app and server (development)

The [Web Toolbox](https://github.com/amwebexpert/etoolbox#start-the-app-locally) GitHub project explains how to start the single-page app locally. Once this app is started, you can then start a poker planning session server as follows:

- ensure the server is up and running by executing `npm run start:dev` which is going to start the server on `localhost:8080`
- open the UI locally at [http://localhost:3000/#/PokerPlanning](http://localhost:3000/#/PokerPlanning)
- type `localhost:8080` inside the `Server` field
- populate the name of your team inside the `Team name` field
- type your username in the corresponding field
- press the `JOIN` button

## Roadmap

- show all values automatically when all participants have voted
- confirmation for deleting all votes: add a 'Yes, dont ask again' button
- add an automatic cleanup of old rooms, based on lastUpdateISO8601 poker session attribute
  - send close signal on each socket of the room?
- add ability to become a room master (the one having more rights on UI side, like being able to remove members)
